DESCRIPTION

The Temperature Monitoring System is a real-time embedded system designed to measure, display, and monitor the surrounding temperature. It can be used in homes, laboratories, server rooms, or industrial environments where continuous temperature supervision is required. The system uses a temperature sensor to capture environmental data and a microcontroller to process and display the information. Optionally, it can also trigger alerts if the temperature crosses a predefined threshold, ensuring safety and efficient environment control.

This project primarily focuses on developing a compact, low-power, and cost-effective solution using commonly available components. The system continuously monitors temperature and displays it on an LCD screen or a mobile application using Bluetooth. The design is simple, allowing easy scalability and future integration with IoT platforms for remote monitoring and data logging.

Components Used:
ESP32 Microcontroller

Acts as the brain of the system. It reads sensor data and processes it for display or transmission.

Offers Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capability for IoT integration.

LM35 / DHT11 / DS18B20 Temperature Sensor

Measures the ambient temperature.

DS18B20 offers high accuracy and waterproof options, while DHT11 is suitable for basic use.

16x2 LCD Display (Optional)

Displays real-time temperature readings.

Bluetooth Module (HC-05) or In-built ESP32 Bluetooth

Sends data wirelessly to a mobile device or PC for remote monitoring.

Power Supply (5V USB or Battery Pack)

Powers the microcontroller and sensors.

Jumper Wires and Breadboard / PCB

For circuit connections and prototyping.

Mobile Application (e.g., Arduino Bluetooth Controller / Custom App)

Receives temperature data wirelessly and displays it.
